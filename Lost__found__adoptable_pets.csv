My name is Belle, well that's the name I was given somewhere along this journey. I'm around 6 years old and looking for a family who can give me all the love I desire. I can't wait to have a home that I can follow my owner around in and cuddle with on the couch during movie time. I've been known to guard my resources (water, food, treats, etc.), so I would do best in an adult only home and with someone who understands to not have food out while children or other animals are around. The staff here feel I'm getting better with this, but I will still always rush to get the first bite when with my play room mate. I am pretty mellow, but I would enjoy getting daily walks to get my little bursts of energy out. I hope you'll come see me soon! I'm currently sleeping at the Petco in Kirkland, and I can't wait to meet you!<p></p> Adoption Fee: $200.00<p></p>"

I am a 10 year old lady who came to the shelter because my previous owner had to move and could not take me along.  If you love black kitties and you are looking for a calm influence, I could be the one for you.<p></p><p></p>I am slightly reserved but appreciate the attention you give me and like to have you pet my head.  I would do best in a home with no small children as I can be just a little bit shy.  I will make a good companion for the right person, so please come and see me soon.<p></p><p></p><p></p>Adoption Fee: An Adoption Fee has not been set. Please inquire with the shelter.<p></p>"
